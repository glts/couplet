# Couplet

Couplet is a small library that provides support for working with Unicode
characters or ‘code points’ in Clojure.

The distinguishing property of this library is the type that represents a
sequence of code points: that type is efficiently seqable and reducible, and
also supports parallel fold via fork/join.

This library targets Clojure on the JVM.
